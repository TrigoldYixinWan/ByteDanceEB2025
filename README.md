Product Highlights — merchant-kb

This document summarizes the key product features and value propositions of the merchant-kb project from a product perspective.

- Intelligent Document Ingestion
  - Supports PDF, Markdown, and plain text uploads with automatic parsing and smart chunking to preserve context.
  - Background processing pipeline converts documents into vector embeddings for semantic retrieval.

- Secure Storage and Access Control
  - Private storage buckets with signed URLs for secure file downloads.
  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enforced through Supabase and middleware to separate merchant and admin views.

- Retrieval-Augmented Chat (RAG)
  - AI-powered chat interface that returns grounded answers with inline citations to source documents.
  - Streaming responses (SSE) for a responsive user experience during long completions.
  - Dual-threshold logic and zero-hit detection to surface when the knowledge base cannot answer.

- Advanced Semantic Search
  - Multi-Query expansion strategy to improve recall and address phrasing variability.
  - Result deduplication and relevance thresholds to maintain precision.
  - Uses `pgvector` for fast vector similarity search inside the database.

- Admin Analytics & Observability
  - Zero-hit tracking, citation heatmaps, and trend reports to measure coverage and improve content.
  - Insights help prioritize document curation and reduce unanswered queries.

- Robust Authentication and Session Flow
  - Supabase Auth for secure sign-in/up, with server-side session synchronization and profile management.
  - Defensive logic (retries/upserts/fallbacks) to ensure consistent user profile creation.

- Scalable Embedding Pipeline
  - Batched embedding generation and bulk inserts for efficient large-document processing.
  - Cost and token estimation utilities to monitor embedding usage.

- UX and Merchant Productivity
  - Merchant portal with categorized documents, recent updates, and persistent chat sessions.
  - Admin dashboard for document management, manual processing triggers, and upload validation.

- Reliability & Maintenance Focus
  - Defensive fixes for PDF library issues, content-type handling, and middleware performance considerations.
  - Clear technical debt items (signed URL refresh, stream interruption handling) documented for follow-up.

Suggested next product priorities
- Improve signed URL refresh and offline access to reduce download failures.
- Add content-quality scoring and automated suggestions to reduce zero-hit rates.
- Provide exportable analytics reports for stakeholders.
